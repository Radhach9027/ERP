# WalmartAssignment

# Design pattern: MVVM+COMBINE

# How to run ?
* clone the repo to your machine via (git clone https://github.com/Radhach9027/WalmartAssignment.git)
* checkout to Radhachandan-WalE
* select your targe device or simulator and run the app, This should do the job.

# Improvements needed:
* Network layer should be segrated to a different work space and can be consumed as a layer in all the apps. Can be improved with other requirements like (upload, download) requests in future.
 
*  Testing can be improved, due to time constraint covered minimum test cases.
