# Project: Nasa Astronomy 

# Design pattern: MVVM+COMBINE

# Network Layer: URLSession

# Offline Display: URLCache

# Image Loader: URLSession

# How to run ?
* clone the repo to your machine via (git clone https://github.com/Radhach9027/WalmartAssignment.git)
* checkout to Radhachandan-WalE
* select your targe device or simulator and run the app, This should do the job.

# Improvements needed: (Couldn't do this due to time constraint)
* Network layer should be segrated to a different work space and can be consumed as a layer in all the apps. Can be improved with other requirements like (upload, download) requests in future.

* Repository should be presented in between service and viewmodel layers, just to handle caching mechanism if we use some kind of storages like(core data, Userdefaults..etc)

* Testing can be improved, just covered minimum test cases with viewModel.
